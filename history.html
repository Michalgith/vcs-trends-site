<h1>Historical Evolution of Version Control Systems</h1>
<p>The evolution of VCS spans several decades, with distinct generations of tools marking key milestones. Early systems were centralized, relying on a single repository server, while later systems introduced distributed collaboration. Here are the major milestones in VCS history, from the 1970 to today:</p>
<ul>
<li>1972: Source Code Control System (SCCS)</li>
<li>1982: Revision Control System (RCS)</li>
<li>1986: Concurrent Versions System (CVS)</li>
<li>2000: Subversion (SVN)</li>
<li>2005: Git and Mercurial</li>
<li>2008: GitHub launched</li>
<li>2010s: Wide adoption of Git and migration from older systems</li>
<li>Late 2010s: GitOps and modern practices</li>
<li>2020s: AI and large-scale collaboration </li>
</ul>
<h1>Why distrubuted systems changed the game</h1>
<p>Centralized Version Control (CVCS): A single central repository on a server holds the “official” copy of the code. Developers commit changes to this server and update (pull) changes from it. Tools like RCS, CVS, and Subversion are centralized. In a CVCS, collaboration requires network access to the server – if the server is down, nobody can commit changes. This model provides a single source of truth and is straightforward to understand: everyone works on the same central codebase . However, it creates a single point of failure (if the central repo is lost or offline, work halts) 12 . Collaboration is linear; merging changes from multiple developers can be challenging, so teams often avoided creating too many branches in the past. </p>
<p>Distributed Version Control (DVCS): In distributed systems like Git or Mercurial, every developer has their own full copy of the repository, including the entire history . There is no inherent single master server – every clone can serve as a remote for others. Developers can commit changes locally to their own repository (even offline), and later push those changes to share with others or pull updates from peers. This offers greater flexibility: work can continue even if no central server is accessible, and there’s redundancy (every clone is a backup of the project). Merging is a first-class operation in DVCS, enabling prolific branching and non-linear development workflows. Teams can still designate a “central” repository by convention (for example, a main project repo on GitHub) – but the tools don’t enforce a single point of authority, it’s a social/project choice</p>
<p>Centralized systems are simple and good for a single source of truth, but suffer from single-point failures and require connectivity for most operations. Distributed systems add complexity in exchange for greater flexibility, offline work, and resilience – these have become dominant in modern development . Many projects that started on CVCS (like Subversion) eventually migrated to DVCS (like Git) to take advantage of these benefits.</p>
