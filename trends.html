<h1>Modern Trends in Version Control</h1>
<p>Modern Trends in Version Control Version control is not a static field – new practices and integrations have emerged in recent years that extend what VCS can do. Here are some modern trends and how they relate to version control::</p>
<ul>
<p>GitOps: Version Control Meets DevOps GitOps<br>is a relatively new approach (coined around 2017) that applies version control to operations and infrastructure. The idea is to treat infrastructure configuration and deployment scripts as code in a Git repository, and to use Git workflows (commits, pull requests) to manage changes to those configurations. In a GitOps workflow, you might have a repository that defines, say, all your cloud infrastructure or Kubernetes cluster configuration in declarative files (YAML, etc.). Any change to your 5infrastructure is done by pushing a change to these files in Git, which then triggers an automated deployment process to apply the change.  (SCCS)</p>
<p>Integration with CI/CD Pipelines<br> software development emphasizes Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery/ Deployment (CD). Version control sits at the heart of CI/CD:</p>
<li> Continuous Integration (CI): Developers frequently merge their code changes (at least daily) into the main branch. Each merge triggers an automated build and test process to catch integration issues early. By using a VCS, every change is tracked, and tools like Jenkins, CircleCI, or GitLab CI can hook into the repository. For example, whenever code is pushed to GitHub, a CI service can automatically run a suite of tests. This tight integration ensures that problems are detected quickly – it’s easier to pinpoint which commit caused a test to fail (RCS)</li>
<li> Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD): After integration and testing, the pipeline can automatically deliver changes to staging or production environments. Version control ensures that deployments are based on known versions (for instance, deploying the exact commit that passed tests). Rollback is straightforward too – if a deployment fails, you can deploy a previous commit from Git.</li>
